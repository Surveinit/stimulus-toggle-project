## 👆🏼 Stimulus Toggle 

This project is a simple demonstration of using Stimulus.js in a Ruby on Rails application to create interactive web elements. 
It features a toggle button that shows and hides content sections on the page. By clicking the button, users can reveal or 
conceal text dynamically without reloading the page. This project showcases how to enhance HTML with minimal JavaScript, 
making it easy to implement interactivity while keeping the code clean and maintainable. 
Perfect for learning the basics of Stimulus and building responsive user interfaces!
